    "    Summary:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This simulation will determine the mean time to get through a speedrun\n",
    "    encounter (designed for The Last of Us Part 2). It takes into account\n",
    "    all the possible locations an attempt might fail by using user-input\n",
    "    data. It assumes all failure points operate on a simple pass/fail basis\n",
    "    and treats every subsequent failure point as statistically dependent on\n",
    "    the success of the previous point. It also treats each time and\n",
    "    probability of possible failure as fixed, which simplifies the inter-\n",
    "    relations between speedrunning RNG-heavy sections and human error.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    By running a simulation of an encounter over many iterations, the user\n",
    "    can get an idea of how much time they may lose due to potential failures.\n",

    "        successful attempt (seconds).\n",
    "    fail_points (array of shape (n*, 2) with floats):\n",
    "        For each array, the first element represents the time (in seconds)\n",
    "        at which a strat may fail (from a RE/RC). The second element\n",
    "        represents the probability (between 0 and 1, exclusive) that the\n",
    "        strat SUCCEEDS at that point.\n",
    "        *n represents the number of failure points, which is not explicitly\n",
